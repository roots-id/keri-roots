# KERI Backer on Cardano
This project is about learning, researching and developing a Proof of Concept of a KERI backer on the Cardano Blockchain.
This project was initially founded by Cardano Catalyst Fund 9. You can find the proposal [here](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/419397).

The folder [keripy](https://github.com/roots-id/keri-roots/tree/main/keripy) is a clone repository from [keripy](https://github.com/weboftrust/keripy) at commit [93557e7](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/commit/93557e467980b69b0bbd79358f3755dafccb16a0) and includes the Cardano Backer functionalities and demos. Note that the code hosted there must be considered as a **Proof of Concept**. We'll be refactoring and improving the code towards a production system that will be published in a different repository. We'll keep you updated here.
